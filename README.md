# Encore

### Core utils library for Clojure/Script

**Or**: What happens when you spend way too much time with Clojure

**Please note**: this is a library intended mostly for my own use or **for advanced users** who are comfortable reading the source code to see what's available + how to use it.

## Recommended steps after any significant dependency update

> These are a good idea when updated **any** dependency, not just encore!

1. Run `lein deps :tree` (or equivalent) to check for possible **dependency conflicts**.
2. Run `lein clean` (or equivalent) to ensure no **stale build artifacts** remain.
3. Please test carefully before running in production!

Some info on how to resolve dependency conflicts [here](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/DEP-CONFLICT.md).
